      <div id="gpmb_body_root"><p>This document contains information curated to help Edinburgh informatics students looking to study abroad at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>
<h3 id="course-registration">Course registration</h3>
<p>There is no guarantee that you will be able to take the courses you want to. Computer science courses are very popular, and regular students with degree requirements are prioritized. The waitlists are very long, so it is vital to act early. I would not recommend Penn if you need to take a lot of computer science courses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are open to multidisciplinary study, Penn is a great place.</p>
<p>You can take Wharton (business school) courses as well as CS graduate level courses.</p>
<h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>
<p>Classes are usually well-taught. Computer science courses follow a similar style to courses in Edinburgh, although the workload tends to be a higher. There are no tutorials or labs, but there will be optional office hours taught by TAs and course instructors. <br>
The business courses I'm taking are innovative. They involve a lot of classroom activities, where I get to grow alongside my peers. I highly recommend taking those while you are at Penn.</p>
<h2 id="social">Social</h2>
<p>At Penn networking and club activities are commonplace. Many students take on a number of clubs. I am currently in 3 clubs. The club activities are more engaging but competitive. I feel that Penn students have a lot more initiative. </p>
<p>There is a lot more events at Penn on campus than at Edinburgh. For example, the Perry World House at Penn hosts international leaders every week. </p>
<h2 id="fees">Fees</h2>
<p>This was very important to me because the living costs in Philadelphia are much higher than in Edinburgh.</p>
<h3 id="housing">Housing</h3>
<p><a href="https://residential-services.business-services.upenn.edu/room-selection#Exchange">https://residential-services.business-services.upenn.edu/room-selection#Exchange</a></p>
<p>Exchange students are required to live on campus. The on-campus accommodation is expensive - there are two bands, one is around 11k USD for 2 semesters and the other is 18k USD for 2 semesters. For the lower band, you may have to share a room with another person or you will not have a kitchen. Many buildings are dilapidated. Contact me if you have any questions about this.</p>
<h3 id="dining">Dining</h3>
<p><a href="https://dining.business-services.upenn.edu/dining-plans/transfer-exchange-upperclass">https://dining.business-services.upenn.edu/dining-plans/transfer-exchange-upperclass</a></p>
<p>Exchange students are required to enroll in a dining plan, which starts from around 2500 USD per year. The dining hall food is not known for being tasty or healthy. Try to get more dining dollars than swipes. </p>
<h3 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h3>
<p><a href="https://wellness.upenn.edu/inreq/#Tips">https://wellness.upenn.edu/inreq/#Tips</a></p>
<p>Exchange students are required to pay a 600 USD clinical fee and get vaccinated. Exchange students are also required to pay for US health insurance (different from UoE's travel insurance), which costs 1000~3000 USD per year depending on the plan you choose.</p>
<h3 id="visa">Visa</h3>
<p>The Visa application costed me around 400 USD. </p>
<h3 id="groceries">Groceries</h3>
<p>The cost of living is quite high in Philadelphia. Although you won't have to pay for bills, grocery shopping is more than twice as expensive as Edinburgh.</p>
<h2 id="philadelphia">Philadelphia</h2>
<p>Penn is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is one of the biggest cities in the US. It takes about 2h to New York City and Washington DC. It is much larger than Edinburgh, and there is a lot more to enjoy. Penn is supposedly a party school, but it didn't feel compelling compared to Edinburgh. </p>
<p>Penn is located in West Philadelphia, which is admittedly a dangerous part of Philadelphia. It is normal to get alerted about armed robberies and assault. There is an ongoing crisis with the crime levels. </p>
<p>Public transport in Philadelphia exists, but it is not as convenient as the bus system in Edinburgh. The campus is walkable.</p>
