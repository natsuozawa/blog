      <div id="gpmb_body_root"><p>This document contains information curated to help Edinburgh informatics students looking to study abroad at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>
<h3 id="course-registration">Course registration</h3>
<p>There is no guarantee that you will be able to take the courses you want to. Computer science courses are very popular, and regular students with degree requirements are prioritized. The waitlists are very long, so it is vital to act early. I would not recommend Penn if you want to take fill your schedule with computer science courses.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are open to multidisciplinary study, Penn is a great place. Many students take Wharton (business school) courses - Wharton is recognized as one of the leading schools in business. Exchange students can also enroll in gaduate level courses. <br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The difficulties with course registration usually only apply for the Fall Semester. For the Spring Semester, exchange students can enroll in Advance Registration, which helps secure spots early. I advise you request enrolment in more courses than you would actually take because securing a spot can still be competitive in Advance Registration for some courses. (For example, if the course has not run for a couple of years)<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You can take up to 5.5 course units (CUs), where each 20 Edinburgh credit course is comparable to a 1 CU course. You can request permission from your Penn academic advisor to take more courses. You must take a minimum of 4 CUs per semester. You can take up to 2 courses outside of the School of Engineering each semester. <br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Computer science courses at Penn require a lot of work (comparable to a 20 credit Edinburgh CS course). Many students take 2-3 CS courses and 1-2 non-CS course. <br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You are expected to take equivalent Penn courses for the credits you miss in Edinburgh. However, the rule is very loose. I didn't have to take equivalents of SDP or ILP. The informatics exchange coordinator was very flexible and understanding.</p>
<h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>
<p>Classes are usually well-taught. I find the professors at Penn to be more engaging. There is a lot more support in office hours and online discussion forums. There are no tutorials or labs usually. Most courses have regular homework assignments, and you'll be engaging with the course content throughout the semester. <br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The business courses I'm taking are innovative. They involve a lot of classroom activities, where I get to grow alongside my peers. I highly recommend taking those while you are at Penn.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the second semester, I am taking the Engineering Entreneurship I course. This is a high-quality course focused on preparing students with the necessary skills to become an entrepreneur. I highly recommend it.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One of the hidden advantages of going on exchange is that there are no strikes in the United States. Teachers are paid well at Penn.</p>
<h3 id="facilities">Facilities</h3>
<p>The buildings at Penn are great. There are a lot more places to study than just Appleton Tower. The library has a lot of books. There are lots of places to do meetings and group study sessions. <br><br>
Tangen Hall (Venture Lab), Wharton Academic Research Building, and Perelman Center for Economics and Political Science are particularly nice. </p>
<h2 id="social">Social</h2>
<p>At Penn, networking and club activities are commonplace. Many students take on a number of clubs. I am currently in 3 clubs. The club activities are more engaging, but they can sometimes be competitive. I feel that Penn students have a lot more initiative.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One of the great things about Penn is that there is a lot more events at Penn on campus than at Edinburgh. Events are well funded. In the beginning of the year, you will be invited to join New Student Orientation (NSO) events, where you will have a week to meet other students. Even after NSO, there will be many events run by a variety of initiatives. For example, the Perry World House at Penn hosts international leaders every week. The Venture Lab brings in speakers each week. Many clubs run their own events. For example, Penn Blockchain runs one of the largest web3 conferences in the nation.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Alcohol is harder to obtain in Pennsylvania, partly because the legal age of drinking is 21. However, there are plenty of places to buy it and plenty of parties to go. Penn has a work hard play hard culture. <br></p>
<h2 id="careers">Careers</h2>
<p>Penn is a career-focused school. There are many career fairs happening throughout the semester, and famous companies will visit campus. There are lots of Penn alumni in said companies. Penn's strengths are mainly in big tech, consulting, and finance. I feel like being a Penn student helped me in getting my summer internship, although this is not a guarantee. Exchange students face difficulty finding sumemr internships in the US because they will not be able to work in the US after graduation. Especially with the current state of the economy, it is best to widen your options.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>With that being said, many preprofessional clubs at Penn help you prepare for your first career.</p>
<h2 id="fees">Fees</h2>
<p>This was very important to me because the living costs in Philadelphia are much higher than in Edinburgh.</p>
<h3 id="housing">Housing</h3>
<p><a href="https://residential-services.business-services.upenn.edu/room-selection#Exchange">https://residential-services.business-services.upenn.edu/room-selection#Exchange</a></p>
<p>Exchange students are required to live on campus. The on-campus accommodation is expensive - there are two bands, one is around 11k USD for 2 semesters and the other is 15k USD for 2 semesters. For the lower band, you may have to share a room with another person or you will not have a kitchen. Contact me if you have any questions about this.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is a really nice building called Gutman College House. It's 2 years old and looks like a hotel. I would highly recommend living there if you can. There is a building called the Radian which will be on-campus housing next year. I also recommend that one if you have the option. The high rises are quite old. I live in one of them. The heating is good, but they are generally dilapidated.</p>
<h3 id="dining">Dining</h3>
<p><a href="https://dining.business-services.upenn.edu/dining-plans/transfer-exchange-upperclass">https://dining.business-services.upenn.edu/dining-plans/transfer-exchange-upperclass</a></p>
<p>Exchange students are required to enroll in a dining plan, which starts from around 2500 USD per year. The dining hall food is not known for being tasty or healthy. Try to get more dining dollars than swipes.</p>
<h3 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h3>
<p><a href="https://wellness.upenn.edu/inreq/#Tips">https://wellness.upenn.edu/inreq/#Tips</a></p>
<p>Exchange students are required to pay a 600 USD clinical fee and get vaccinated. Exchange students are also required to pay for US health insurance (different from UoE's travel insurance), which costs 1000~3000 USD per year depending on the plan you choose.</p>
<h3 id="visa">Visa</h3>
<p>The Visa application costed me around 400 USD.</p>
<h3 id="groceries">Groceries</h3>
<p>The cost of living is quite high in Philadelphia. Although you won't have to pay for bills, grocery shopping is more than twice as expensive as Edinburgh.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: If you go take a 15 minute tram to Trader Joe's in Center City, the prices aren't that bad.</p>
<h2 id="philadelphia">Philadelphia</h2>
<p>Penn is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is one of the biggest cities in the US. It takes about 2h to New York City and Washington DC. This is really nice because I can go to a lot of New York events I'm interested in. It is much larger than Edinburgh, and there is a lot more to enjoy. Philadelphia has a nationally popular art museum and a world-class orchestra. I'm clearly not the best person to ask for information on entertainment (Sorry). <br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Penn is located in West Philadelphia, which is admittedly a dangerous part of Philadelphia. It is normal to get alerted about armed robberies and assault. There is an ongoing crisis with the crime levels.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Public transport in Philadelphia exists, but it is not as convenient as the bus system in Edinburgh. The campus is walkable.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The weather is not that diffent from Edinburgh. It's less rainy and there's more sun, which is nice.</p>
